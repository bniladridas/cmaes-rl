# CartPole-v1 CMA-ES Solution: Release Overview

## What is included?
- **A complete codebase** for training and evaluating a CartPole agent using CMA-ES (no neural networks, pure evolutionary optimization).
- **Pretrained model weights** (`cmaes_model.npy`, `cmaes_model.pth`) for instant evaluation.
- **A minimal, modern web UI** (`index.html`) for project presentation.
- **A Hugging Face model card** with a video preview showing the agent in action.
- **All scripts and assets** needed for training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Optimal CartPole-v1 performance:** Achieves the maximum possible reward (500) consistently, demonstrating the power of evolutionary strategies for classic RL tasks.
- **Minimal, readable code:** Linear policy, no deep learning, easy to understand and extend.
- **Reproducibility:** All code, weights, and training details are provided for full transparency.
- **Cross-platform presentation:** README and video preview work on Hugging Face; static image and links for GitHub compatibility.
- **Open-source and MIT licensed:** Freely reusable for research, education, or as a baseline for further work.

## Who is this for?
- Researchers and students interested in evolutionary strategies for RL.
- Anyone looking for a simple, high-performing CartPole baseline.
- Developers wanting a clean, minimal RL project template.

## How to use it?
- **Train your own agent:** Run the provided training scripts.
- **Evaluate the pretrained agent:** Use the test scripts or load the weights in your own code.
- **See it in action:** Watch the video preview or run the agent with rendering enabled.
